# Voice commands go on the left side of the '='. The console command goes on the right side.
# To string console commands together, use '+'
# To run the same command multiple times, use "* number of time to run" (See example)

# Example of a single command: I am a god = tgm
# Example of two commands: (I am a god)(make me a god) = tgm

# There is no limit on the number of voice commands
# There is no limit on the number of console commands you can string together
