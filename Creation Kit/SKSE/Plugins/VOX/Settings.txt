This is where you can change the program's settings manually.
Note: Changing settings manually requires you to restart the program before they take effect.

Options for each setting:
	Default Hand = "Left", "Right", "Both"
	AutoStart = "True", "False"		//Runs the program in the background when Skyrim is not open and speech recognition is NOT enabled.
	Start With Computer = "True", "False"
	Sensitivity = {0 : 1}	//Controls how sensitive the system is to commands. 0 is very sensitive, one is least sensitive, and 0.5 is inbetween
	Require Hand Selector = "True", "False"	//Determines whether saying "Left", "Right", "Both", or "Cast" are required to say. Meaning "Flames" won't work, but "Left Flames" will

Change the settings below.
